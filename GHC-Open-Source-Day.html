<h2>How To Get Started<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-get-started" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Welcome to Oppia! This wiki page aims to provide a quick-start guide to Oppia and guide you in making your first changes to Oppia’s codebase. For a longer, more comprehensive guide to getting started, please see our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up">full “Getting Started” page</a>.</p>
<p>Some background info about the project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Oppia codebase sits in Github at https://github.com/oppia. Some knowledge of Github would be useful to make changes to the repository. Take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Github guides</a> for a brief introduction to Github along with some common methods!</p></li>
<li><p>AngularJS (v1) is used for Oppia’s frontend. A nice youtube video tutorial can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO1ROKMjPqI&amp;list=PLvZkOAgBYrsS_ugyamsNpCgLSmtIXZGiz">here</a>. For an outline of AngularJS, please see this <a class="reference external" href="https://egghead.io/articles/new-to-angularjs-start-learning-here">short overview</a> with pointers to other resources.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are new to HTML, some useful tutorials are <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Mozilla’s guide</a> (which includes some practice assessments), as well as <a class="reference external" href="http://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/">this tutorial for beginners</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Some new features will require backend work. Oppia’s backend is written in Python 2.7.</p></li>

<h2>Making A Code Change<a class="headerlink" href="#making-a-code-change" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Our central development branch is <strong>develop</strong>, which should be clean and ready for release at any time. In general, all changes should be done as feature branches based off of <em>develop</em>. For a more detailed explanation on how to make a code change, please take a look at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#instructions-for-making-a-code-change">this wiki page</a>.
In order to make a change in the repository, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Sync with the <em>develop</em> branch and create a new branch, starting from <em>develop</em> (e.g. <em>your-branch-name</em>). The branch name should be descriptive, lowercase, and hyphen-separated. It shouldn’t start with the words <em>hotfix</em> or <em>release</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git fetch upstream
git checkout develop  
git merge upstream/develop 
git checkout -b your-branch-name
</pre></div>
</div>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Make commit(s) to your feature branch. Each commit should be self-contained and have a descriptive commit message that helps other developers understand why the changes were made.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Before your code gets uploaded to GitHub, a script is automatically executed that checks the styling of all changed files and runs some front-end tests. <strong>Run the ‘push’ command in command line</strong> as the script needs access to other tools like pip.</p></li>
<li><p>If any of the tests fail, the push will be interrupted. If this happens, fix the issues that the tests tell you about and repeat the instructions above (‘commit’ and then ‘push’).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When your feature is ready to merge, create a pull request on Github. When you create a pull request, you will be assigned a reviewer who will take a look at your code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Address review comments until all reviewers give LGTM (‘looks good to me’).</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Resolve any merge conflicts that arise.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">-m</span> <span class="pre">scripts.start</span></code> and play with the dev server in order to make sure that everything still works, and also to install any new dependencies that have been added since you last synced the repo.</p></li>
<li><p>WARNING: Do not make changes using the online GitHub editor – this bypasses lint/presubmit checks, and will cause the code on GitHub to diverge from the code on your machine. Always make commits locally, and then push to GitHub.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Tidy up! After the PR status has changed to “Merged”, delete the feature branch from both your local clone and the GitHub repository</p></li>
<li><p>Celebrate. Congratulations, you have contributed to Oppia!</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="what-to-do-when-you-are-stuck">
<h2>What to do when you are stuck<a class="headerlink" href="#what-to-do-when-you-are-stuck" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Oppia has a <a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/oppia/oppia-chat">Gitter chat room</a> where everyone can post their questions and help each other out! The organizers and mentors will also be walking around to help with any questions. We also have a dedicated <a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/oppia/ghc2018">GHC Open Source Day chatroom</a> that you can use too!</p>
</section>
<section id="list-of-projects">
<h2>List of Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#list-of-projects" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>For Open Source Day, we tried to shortlist projects that are fairly self-contained, and can be completed within 3-4 hours by a group of 2-3 people. We also tried to pick those projects directly from our issue tracker, so that you get an idea of what it’s like to contribute to Oppia on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Each project has a brief explanation, a link to the issue tracker, the skills required, and some deliverables. We encourage you to look at the issue tracker link for the project that interests you. You can comment expressing interest in that project (and mention you will be working on it for OSD). Feel free to ask questions on the issue thread to gain more context, to help get a kickstart for the day! <strong>We recommend working in groups of 2-3 people.</strong></p>
<p>This list is not an exhaustive list of projects. If none of these projects appeal to you, take a look at our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues">issue tracker</a> and comment on an issue that interests you. (Also, please mention that you will be working on it during the OSD event, so that others are aware. Please also tag us (<strong>&#64;seanlip</strong> and <strong>&#64;vinitamurthi</strong>) in any comment expressing interest in a project so that we get notified about this!)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some of the projects relate to functionality (like topics, skills and questions) that is still in development. You can turn it on by flipping the ENABLE_NEW_STRUCTURES flag in feconf.py. Also, if you’d like to understand the vocabulary and general structure of content in Oppia, please take a look at <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFrFAXaKARzj1DSfiiy1pOH6ypugNkRLQGz5W5QifMQ/edit?usp=sharing">this document</a>. Please don’t hesitate to ask us if you have any questions about this!</p>

<h3>Project List<a class="headerlink" href="#project-list" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We’ve tried to categorize the projects by difficulty, but please note that this is just a rough estimate and your mileage may vary. Feel free to pick any project that interests you :)</p>
<p>Also, we recommend trying any file within Project 8 (unit tests) before taking on larger projects, so that you can get a good feel for the codebase and the development workflow. You’re welcome to do this before Open Source Day, if you like!</p>

<h3>Project 1: Implement a reusable sort/filter list view for skills<a class="headerlink" href="#project-1-implement-a-reusable-sort-filter-list-view-for-skills" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>We are currently working on organizing our lessons into topics. At Oppia, a topic is a high-level concept related to a subject. Each topic can have multiple skills within it – for example, the topic “Fractions” may contain the skill “find the sum of two fractions with the same denominator”. Questions will always be tied to a skill, and when we want to test a skill, we look up questions for that particular skill. Hence, when creating topics, as well as questions, we need to go through a list of skills to tie that topic/question to. Unfortunately, the number of skills can be extremely large and going through such a big list gets difficult. So we would like to have a simple sort/filter view for the skills, which is reusable wherever the skills are listed down. (Bonus: Instead of creating a reusable sort/filter view only for skills, it would be nice to have a generic sort/filter list view that can be used for all types of data). Note that, since the feature is currently in development, you’ll need to enable the feconf.ENABLE_NEW_STRUCTURES flag and log in as an admin to use the skill editor.

<h3>Project 4: Allow users to suggest new questions for a skill<a class="headerlink" href="#project-4-allow-users-to-suggest-new-questions-for-a-skill" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>We are currently working on a project to add practice questions to Oppia. Currently, Oppia supports the creation of questions by topic managers and admins. However, in the long run, Oppia aims to be a collaborative platform for create lessons, so it would be great if we could enable any user to suggest a new question for a particular skill. These suggestions can then be reviewed and then either added (with or without modifications), or rejected. We need to design a framework to support this option. We already have a suggestion framework designed for edits to lesson content, and if possible we would like to reuse that for question suggestions as well.</p>
<p><em>This project is more aimed at creating a design rather than a working implementation, as it is quite open ended and will take time to create a working solution. However, if you plan on taking this up, we encourage you to continue to work with us on this project even after open source day!</em>

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>We are developing a feature that allows topic managers to add concept cards whenever they create a topic. These concept cards each aim to explain a particular skill, and they get shown on-demand in lessons when Oppia detects that a student is having difficulty with that skill. It would be very useful to have users suggest edits to the concept cards. Edit suggestions could range from grammar issues or typos, semantic improvements, or even adding new content like examples to better explain the concept. The topic manager can review the edit, and either add it (with modifications), or reject it with some explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>All lessons in Oppia aim to have audio subtitles for learners who do not have a good command of English. These audio files are translated to multiple languages by translators. Currently, when a lesson creator marks an audio file as “needing update”, the translators get informed about this through a warning icon, but it’s not easy for them to figure out what changes the lesson creator has made. We would like to develop this functionality for the translators. For this, we would have to design and implement a UI which helps translators identify where the change was made and what the change was.

Oppia has a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Coding-style-guide">style guide</a> that highlights basic requirements for coding style. To ensure our code follows the style guide, we use lint-check scripts that are called before any code is pushed in the github repo. However, our Python linter doesn’t check if strings use single quotes and not double quotes. It would be useful to have that check added for Python as well.

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>Unit tests are just as important as coding style while maintaining a large codebase with multiple contributors. At Oppia, we try to ensure all code paths are covered by some unit test. This also ensures that changes to the code don’t break our code base. Before pushing code to github, we run all frontend tests and the push is blocked if even one test is broken. Also, code cannot be merged into the main branch unless both frontend and backend tests pass (the backend checks are done through a <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis</a> continuous integration system). We analyze the code coverage of unit tests to identify which functions still need unit tests.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>While unit tests cover a lot of cases, end-to-end integration tests are also extremely useful to ensure all UI elements are working as intended. It can also catch bugs that unit tests may not be able to, such as UI elements not being in view, browsers freezing, and so on. We use Protractor end-to-end tests to cover these cases (Protractor is an end-to-end testing framework based on Selenium). The goal would be to pick up one of Oppia’s question types (“interactions”) and write Protractor tests for it that are similar to the existing examples for other interactions in the codebase.

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>A pretest is a variably-long set of questions that has been randomly created from the list of prerequisite skills specified by a lesson. Before learning a lesson with prerequisites, students have to pass the pretest for every prerequisite skill. Currently, the first 3 pretest questions sorted by their keys will be returned for a fixed set of prerequisite skill ids for an exploration. This needs to be changed to make it a random set of 3 questions (or potentially some other smarter approach to selecting the questions).

<p>Audio subtitles in lessons are really important for learners in our target audience. However, we have encountered several issues with the Safari browser. For example, the translation console in Safari doesn’t play the audio correctly. Users have reported that after uploading audio, they click on the icon to the far left to listen but nothing happens. This is only on Safari; it works fine in Chrome.
Also, the audio player at the bottom shows NaN/NaN which indicates that the audio is most likely not loading correctly on Safari. The UI elements also dont seem to be rendered correctly. We would like to fix the audio player experience for the translation console on Safari browsers.

<h3>Project 17: Improving the library page experience on mobile<a class="headerlink" href="#project-17-improving-the-library-page-experience-on-mobile" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>The Oppia library can show only one exploration at a time on the mobile UI. It has arrow icons that can be clicked to move to the next exploration, but this is not very intuitive for mobile views, especially now that swipe gestures are so common. We would like to make the explorations into a swipeable carousel for the mobile UI.

<li><p>(Optional) Create a reusable swipeable carousel element that can be used as a template. Write a design document for this as well</p></li>

<h3>Project 18: Accessibility Improvements - Tabbing Order<a class="headerlink" href="#project-18-accessibility-improvements-tabbing-order" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>We have found some accessibility-related issues in Oppia that we would like to improve. This project looks at tabbing order. Tabbing is useful for screen readers and various other accessibility software, and our order of tabbing is wrong; we would like to fix that. More details can be found in the issue tracker:

<h3>Project 19: Accessibility Improvements - Fixing Contrast in Image Region Selectors<a class="headerlink" href="#project-19-accessibility-improvements-fixing-contrast-in-image-region-selectors" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>Our Image region indicators show a red dot when a user clicks on a portion of the image (regardless of the image background at that area). The aim of this issue is to ensure that the indicator contrasts with the background, so that it’s clear that it’s a touch indicator.

<p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Design and implement a solution that can clearly show image region indicators to the user (either by using dots with contrasting colors, or using a different shape or a larger size)</p></li>
