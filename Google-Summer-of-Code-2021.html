<p>Oppia has been selected to participate in <a class="reference external" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code 2021</a>! GSoC is a global program which offers post-secondary students an opportunity to discover and work with open source organizations over the course of 3 months, while being paid a stipend. Students work closely with one or more mentors from an open source organization in order to implement either a project idea by the organization, or a proposal of their own.</p>
<p>In order to receive updates about GSoC at Oppia please subscribe to <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/g/oppia-gsoc-announce">Oppia GSoC Announce</a>.</p>
<p>You might be interested in our GSoC info pages from previous years: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2020">2020</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2019">2019</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2018">2018</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2017">2017</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2016">2016</a>.</p>
<p>Also, please note that acceptance into GSoC isn’t a prerequisite for becoming an Oppia contributor. The Oppia project is run by the community for the community, and we warmly welcome anyone who’d like to help out!

<h2>Completed Projects:<a class="headerlink" href="#completed-projects" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The following projects were fully completed during GSoC 2021:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="xref myst">Abhay Garg’s proposal</span> and <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;prayutsu/google-summer-of-code-2021-oppia-7cb7588667ec">final blog post</a>: Introduce support for displaying copyright licenses in the app. Mentor: Rajat Talesra</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 1:</strong> Introduce a script for generating a list of dependencies using a reverse-deps lookup of Oppia Android’s //third_party Maven dependencies. Introduce a script for converting the dependency list to actual license content files.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 2:</strong> Introduce &amp; hook-up a UI to properly display all of the licenses included in the app. Introduce a GitHub Actions check to verify that the list of dependencies is kept up-to-date over time. Introduce extra checks to ensure that generations of the license files can’t be accidentally checked into the repository.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="xref myst">Aditya Dubey’s proposal</span> and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SK-n2Av8yb6rPPZh5XkyLarV-3GLNpr0JaH6rLTGat4/edit?usp=sharing">final blog post</a>: Move custom JS\TS lint checks to eslint. Mentor: Anshul Hudda</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 1:</strong> Migrate all JS/TS lint checks to custom Eslint checks (#10816). Implement 3 E2E lint checks from #8423.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 2:</strong> Implement remaining 1 E2E lint check from #8423 and move all BAD_PATTERNS_JS_AND_TS_REGEXP from general_purpose_linter.py to custom eslint checks.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="xref myst">Aishwary Saxena’s proposal</span> and <a class="reference external" href="https://aishwary023.github.io/gsoc-2021-oppia/">final blog post</a>: Write frontend tests. Mentor: Kevin Thomas</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 1:</strong> Fully cover half of the assigned code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 2:</strong> Fully cover all of the assigned code.</p></li>
<li><p>List of Files for Aishwary: <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tky4jE7uxLQTp0MWE3L9USnPvy3PbtGYpMgP7b0bicw/edit#gid=2101159169">Link</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="xref myst">Apoorv Srivastava’s proposal</span> and <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;MaskedCarrot/google-summer-of-code-2021-oppia-d2e346508bb9">final blog post</a>: Implement lightweight checkpointing. Mentor: Pulkit Aggarwal</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 1:</strong> Implement domain layer changes for creating, checking and restoring checkpoints. Checkpoints should also be automatically expired on a least-recently-used policy basis if more than 2MB of space are consumed by checkpoints (per profile).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 2:</strong> Implement the UI changes needed to represent checkpoints that are in progress, changes to existing notices, and proper UI/domain layer support for automatically expiring checkpoints when the user has been away from the app for too long or if the app has decided to automatically expire a checkpoint to save space.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="xref myst">Arjun Gupta’s proposal</span> and <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;arjupta/google-summer-of-code-2021-with-oppia-23758362d710">final blog post</a>: Implement feature flags &amp; platform parameters. Mentor: Vinita Murthi</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 1:</strong> Introduce platform parameter system that has support for compile-time definitions (i.e. using Dagger modules and dagger constants). The resulting platform parameter support should be built such that we can easily combine the compile-time gating with runtime parameters. Introduce an integration test that verifies the compile-time feature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 2:</strong> Introduce runtime parameter support by hooking up to Oppia backend’s platform parameter API &amp; connecting these flags back to the predefined compile-time parameters. The lifecycle of these parameters need to be carefully managed: they should not be applied until the app restarts. This part of the project will include caching results from the server, and introducing a lightweight synchronization mechanism so that the app periodically verifies that its copies of the parameters are up-to-date. When the device is offline or the flag fetching fails, the flags should have appropriate defaults for the runtime parameters. Enhance the previous integration test in M1, to demonstrate the usage of runtime flags.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="xref myst">Aryaman Gupta’s proposal</span> and <a class="reference external" href="https://atpug22.medium.com/google-summer-of-code-2021-with-oppia-d61fb8c848ca">final blog post</a>: Improve Exploration save flow: Syncing edits in the background. Mentor: Kevin Thomas</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 1:</strong> Introduce functionality such that edits made to an exploration by a user are propagated to all clients.

<h2>Getting started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>If you’re interested in applying to work with Oppia for GSoC, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Sign up to the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/oppia-gsoc-announce">oppia-gsoc-announce&#64;</a> mailing list in order to receive important notifications about Oppia’s participation in GSoC. If you like, you can also sign up to the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/oppia-gsoc-discuss">oppia-gsoc-discuss&#64;</a> mailing list to participate in general discussion related to Oppia’s involvement in GSoC (see point 6 below, too). Make sure to set your preferences correctly so that you actually get the emails!</p></li>
<li><p>Get a better understanding of what Oppia is all about by taking a look at our <a class="reference external" href="http://oppia.github.io/#/">user documentation</a> – this will help you become familiar with important concepts like explorations and interactions. We also recommend having a go at playing lessons on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.oppia.org/splash">Oppia.org</a>, which hosts a live instance of Oppia.</p></li>
<li><p>Read and follow the instructions in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up">contributors’ guide</a> carefully.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider taking up one or more starter projects in order to become familiar with the contribution process. This will help us get an idea of what it’s like to work with you – e.g. how independent, resourceful, responsive, etc. you are. It will also help you get a better understanding of the codebase, so that you can write a good, detailed project proposal.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Pro-tip!</strong> Quality is more important than quantity; we want to see examples of your best work. So, please make sure to follow the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#instructions-for-making-a-code-change">dev workflow</a> carefully, manually test your code before submitting (to ensure it does what you want it to and doesn’t break anything else), ensure that your code conforms to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Coding-style-guide">style rules</a>, and pay attention to small details. These are good skills to learn when developing software in general, and they will also help you build credibility as a responsible developer who can be trusted to be a good steward of the Oppia codebase.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Once you’ve merged at least 2 pull requests, you will get an invitation to become a collaborator to the Oppia repository and be officially onboarded! <strong>This step is a prerequisite</strong> to applying for GSoC.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, you can select one or more GSoC projects that you’re most interested in, and write your project proposal! We strongly encourage you to discuss your project ideas and share your proposal with the community, so that you can get feedback and ensure that what you’re writing makes sense to others. The best way to do this is to put your proposal into a collaborative editing tool like Google Docs, allow others to comment on it, and share a link to it on the <a class="reference external" href="mailto:oppia-gsoc-discuss&#37;&#52;&#48;googlegroups&#46;com">GSoC discussion mailing list</a>. You can also email this mailing list if you have any questions about a project, or would like to discuss your approach with the Oppia community and get feedback. Please be specific when asking questions, since this makes it easier for us to help you.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Important note:</strong> Please read <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21topic/oppia-gsoc-discuss/S6Ge3vQ3cuc">this oppia-gsoc-discuss&#64; thread</a> carefully for details about the recommended review process.

<h2>FAQs<a class="headerlink" href="#faqs" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Q: What technical skills do I need to work on Oppia?</strong></p>
<p>A: Familiarity with AngularJS (v1), Angular8, Python 2.7 and Google App Engine is useful and recommended for most Oppia work. In addition, UI design skills are useful for frontend, user-facing work. Please see the individual project ideas to determine whether these skills are recommended for the project in question.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I increase my chances of getting selected?</strong></p>
<p>A: Writing a good project proposal, engaging with the community, helping other students, successfully contributing patches, and demonstrating that you can work independently can all help you. We’ve also compiled some notes below on the <a class="reference external" href="#selection-criteria">selection criteria</a> we’ll be using this year.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you be flexible around my other commitments in the summer?</strong></p>
<p>A: This year, GSoC is going to be slightly different. The program has been restructured in way that allow students to take some time off for any other commitments (such as exams etc) <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline">(View the timeline here)</a>. Oppia will respect the same timelines as given by GSoC, the main concern is whether you can still get the project done on time. Be upfront about your other commitments and make sure you schedule your time accordingly when creating your proposal. Other commitments you should list include time when you’ll be in school and will commit less time to GSoC, time when you’ll be travelling and away from GSoC work, any summer jobs you need to commit to, etc. We will try to be flexible around other time commitments, as long as your proposal convinces us that you will have enough time to complete the project by the end of the summer. On the other hand, if you do not disclose other commitments, and it turns out that you are unable to commit to what you wrote on your proposal, this is grounds for failing the program.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which projects are most important for Oppia?</strong></p>
<p>A: All the projects we’ve listed here are important, and we’d be very happy to see good progress made on any of them! Projects are treated as equally important during selection. Note that the relative importance of a project to Oppia is not part of the <a class="reference external" href="#selection-criteria">selection criteria</a>. We would encourage you to pick a project that you would enjoy doing over the summer.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I submit more than one proposal to Oppia?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes you can. However, we strongly recommend picking one project and writing a solid proposal for it. Splitting attention across multiple projects might not be a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How early should I start working on the proposal?</strong></p>
<p>A: As early as possible. Make sure to get feedback from mentors before finally submitting the proposal. This will help you to write a better proposal as you can refine the details based on the feedback you receive. The mentors would need some time to review, and hence it is a good idea to begin as early as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I only discovered this project recently. Does this mean that, during selection, my application would automatically be ranked lower than those by other applicants who have a longer tenure with Oppia?</strong></p>
<p>A: Definitely not! Here are the <a class="reference external" href="#selection-criteria">selection criteria</a> we use when selecting students for GSoC; note that tenure is not part of these criteria. Also, our philosophy is to consider each application based on its own merits, not relative to other applications, and we try to accept every student whose application “meets the bar”. The only cases in which we’d need to compare applications against each other are when a project idea receives multiple applications, or we receive fewer “slots” to host students than we originally applied for.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the minimum number of PRs that one should have?</strong></p>
<p>A: There is no specific minimum number. Remember that quality is more important than quantity. It is better to submit a nontrivial PRs rather than a simple bug fix. Start with starter issues, then prioritize ones that are related to your project.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the total number we’ll accept?</strong></p>
<p>A: As many as we think we’ll succeed, though GSoC admins may impose quotas.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I do not have any experience in some XYZ skill. Is some certification required?</strong></p>
<p>A: Try to work on good first issues and take courses online. You develop experience &amp; expertise once you start working. We do not need any certification.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is it okay to focus only on the frontend or backend?</strong></p>
<p>A: This depends on your project. Focus on the project’s goals.</p>

<h2>GSoC Proposal Template<a class="headerlink" href="#gsoc-proposal-template" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>When submitting a proposal, please use the provided <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZ8yJG70zoANYGJgOv5wsIzz3arOX4Up4EJqfUU6nis/edit">GSoC proposal template</a>. We will only consider proposals submitted using this template.</p>
<p>You are welcome to ask mentors for reviews during the proposal preparation phase. Mentors will review proposals incrementally. That is, they will work through the Mocks section, and, only after they are satisfied with it, they will review the Technical Design section, and, similarly, only after that section looks good, they will review the Milestones section. This is meant to help ensure that later sections of the proposal are building on a solid baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Please make sure that your final proposal is self-contained. In particular, to be fair to all applicants, key components of the proposal should not be editable after the deadline, and you shouldn’t assume that reviewers will follow external links.</p>
<section id="tips-for-writing-a-good-project-plan">
<h3>Tips for writing a good project plan<a class="headerlink" href="#tips-for-writing-a-good-project-plan" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Here’s some advice about proposals and milestone timeline planning that we collated from previous students and mentors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Choose a project you’re interested in! If you have a strong interest in your project, this will help you pick up necessary skills and tackle any unforeseen difficulties that arise during GSoC.</p></li>
<li><p>Familiarize yourself with the relevant part of the codebase for your project, especially if you haven’t touched it before. It’s important to think about how to integrate your project with the current Oppia structure – don’t design in a vacuum.</p></li>
<li><p>Define milestones with enough detail to get a proper ETA for each milestone (so, don’t just say “write e2e tests”), otherwise you run the risk of significantly underestimating the timeline.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear written communication and presentation is crucial in preparing your proposal. The proposal should show that you have a clear understanding of the codebase and the final goal of the project. Eg. In a user-facing proposal, writing about just the files that have to be changed is not enough, detailed mocks and userflows (in the form of diagrams or points) are also essential.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit proposal length. Remember a lengthy proposal is not equivalent to an excellent proposal.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the problem statement is within your limits to tackle. You should make sure that what you are proposing is within your capabilities. What we have in the <a class="reference external" href="#oppias-project-ideas-list">project ideas section</a> are suggested milestones; it is up to you to come up with a complete plan that is within your ability. i.e., students can propose whatever they want; it’s up to us to subsequently figure out (during selection) whether we’re happy about what’s being proposed.</p></li>
<li><p>Students who make the last milestone bulky normally run into issues. So, make sure that you distribute work evenly.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>What should applicants expect from mentors in a proposal review?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-should-applicants-expect-from-mentors-in-a-proposal-review" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Please write your proposal on the assumption that you “own” your chosen project. From your perspective, the submitted proposal should be in as good a condition as possible before you ask for a review. Make sure you have a sufficiently good understanding of the codebase/project to find flaws in the design; don’t assume that reviewers are responsible for doing this for you. Note that your proposal doesn’t need to be flawless – we expect that you might make mistakes, and reviewers will be happy to guide you on how to improve. Instead, by “as good a condition as possible”, we mean that your proposal should demonstrate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your ownership of the project</p></li>
<li><p>The research you have put into writing it</p></li>
<li><p>Your analytical skills</p></li>
<li><p>Your independence in making complex decisions</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure to present solutions and ask for feedback, rather than just asking for solutions. You can do this by presenting the various solutions you came up with in your proposal, and doing an analysis of their advantages &amp; disadvantages from the end-user perspective. Finally, choose the best solution you have and explain your reasoning behind your choice. Note that this doesn’t mean that you must always have multiple ideas to solve a problem, but you should instead always explain how you reached a solution, and why is it the best one from the end-user’s perspective.</p></li>
<li><p>Mentor’s suggestions are “suggestions”, not orders (often, reviewers may not be certain whether their suggestion is correct), so, as the proposal owner, you are welcome to decide whether to accept/reject it. In either case, when you are accepting/rejecting a suggestion provided by a reviewer, explain your reasoning and the research that led to your decision. Don’t use an “appeal to authority” (e.g. “I am doing it this way because XXX said so”) – the rational analysis that underlies the decision is what’s important.</p></li>
<li><p>We do not expect you to always agree with your reviewers. If you think that the suggestion doesn’t suit your project, it is totally fine to explain your decision and provide reasons for it. It is always a good idea to have discussions when you have confusions, rather than simply agreeing. Note that this does not mean that we encourage you to disagree with your reviewers on everything – this is just a suggestion to bear in mind if you get confused.</p></li>
<li><p>Please note that your reviewer may or may not be involved in the final selection process. It is also <strong>not</strong> the case that you need to implement all your reviewers’ suggestions/requests in order to be selected. As mentioned above, it is important that you actively take help and work together with your proposal reviewers in order to prepare a strong proposal that meets the guidelines for your chosen project.</p></li>

<h2>Types of work related to Oppia projects<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-work-related-to-oppia-projects" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In order to ensure a well-rounded engineering experience, developers will do some or all of the following depending on their project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Meet with their mentors regularly</p></li>
<li><p>Meet with other contributors related to their project area</p></li>
<li><p>Read and understand parts of the code base related to their project</p></li>
<li><p>Receive code reviews for all code they write for their project</p></li>
<li><p>Write automated tests for their projects</p></li>
<li><p>Create UI mocks (if doing frontend development)</p></li>
<li><p>Write design documents (if implementing large features or introducing new systems)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We asked our previous students what they learned during GSoC 2020. Here are the collated answers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Technical ability</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Writing clean code, while keeping in mind the requirement for the code to run in production.</p></li>
<li><p>Working on a large codebase.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading and understanding code from other open source organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>Automated testing</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Technical domain knowledge</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I feel more confident on working with Angular. Oppia was the first time I worked with unit, e2e tests. I feel a lot more confident in writing code now whether be it making my own projects or contributing to other open source projects.</p></li>
<li><p>I learned lots of things about typescript and webpack.</p></li>
<li><p>I understood how E2E tests and angular migrations worked in Oppia – this felt very rewarding.</p></li>
<li><p>I enjoyed finding and fixing accessibility issues.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Technical leadership skills</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to improve in planning.</p></li>
<li><p>Reviewing others’ code</p></li>
<li><p>Technical design skills (and validation of technical ideas)</p></li>
<li><p>Organizing work flow, meetings management</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Communication</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Putting forward my thoughts more systematically and deeply so that everyone can understand me well.</p></li>
<li><p>Better communication skills.</p></li>
<li><p>How to write a good proposal.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>I’ve become more independent and confident over the course of this project. This is not just due to my improvement in the technical aspect, but more importantly, I now know how to start, work through and successfully finish a large scale project. I feel like I can independently and confidently work on more big projects in the future and the fear of “being lost” that I had, has now significantly been reduced.</p></li>

<section id="selection-criteria">
<h2>Selection Criteria<a class="headerlink" href="#selection-criteria" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In order to select students for GSoC, we will mainly be looking at three things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The quality of the submitted proposal</p></li>
<li><p>The quality of the applicant’s previously-submitted PRs (in order to assess their ability to code, debug, break down complex tasks, etc.). Note that quantity isn’t a prerequisite in itself, though contributors who’ve submitted multiple PRs are likely to have had more opportunities to demonstrate the abilities needed to succeed in GSoC.</p></li>
<li><p>Our prior experience working with the student (do they keep commitments, communicate well, demonstrate independence/initiative/responsiveness, help others, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that strong performance in these dimensions is likely to correlate well with the student having an enjoyable, fulfilling and productive experience over the summer, and successfully completing the GSoC program.</p>
<p>For the proposal, we generally look for a clear indication that the student has a good, deep understanding of the project, and has broken it down sufficiently well, in a way that makes it very likely to succeed. Some indicators that could help with this include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A clear analysis of (and good design decisions that build on top of) the original project idea, with a strong focus on creating a simple, intuitive experience for end users.</p></li>
<li><p>A concrete, specific breakdown of the work to be done for each milestone. Here’s an <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vuwXvHOYXqfM2S2B2KIWhZrAa1PL59wJRUYsqJEd67E/edit">example</a> from a previous design doc. (Note that, in the implementation plan, the author has carefully considered and listed which tests need to be written alongside the code; this is a positive indicator.)</p></li>
<li><p>Sufficient concreteness (e.g. references to particular files and methods) to demonstrate that the applicant is familiar with both the scope of the problem and the existing codebase.</p></li>
<li><p>A description, if applicable, of how the applicant plans to mitigate risks that could potentially derail the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear, unambiguous communication. (This is important; your proposal will be read by many mentors!)</p></li>

<h3>Solving dev-workflow issues<a class="headerlink" href="#solving-dev-workflow-issues" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This project will focus on tackling some of the interesting issues in the Oppia development workflow. There are 2 parts in the project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The first part of the project focuses on restructuring the existing lint checks. We want to move the existing custom lint scripts to pylint.</p></li>
<li><p>The second part of the project focuses on automating the task of code ownership transfer in Oppia Org. The current process of transferring code ownership is quite manual, and also lacks flexibility in terms of the options that it provides to the codeowners, so the aim is to come up with a design to overcome those shortcomings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Mentors:</strong> &#64;sajalasati, &#64;DubeySandeep</p>
<p><strong>Consider taking up this project if you:</strong></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Know how to code in Python, Javascript.</p></li>
<li><p>Enjoy refactoring code.</p></li>
<li><p>Enjoy the system designing process to come up with a solution based on requirements that covers all test cases.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What we’re looking for in the proposal:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Link to one or more PRs showing contribution to the linter project or other dev-workflow issues.</p></li>
<li><p>The second part of the project is open for design, so we expect the proposed design to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>cover all the edge cases of problem,</p></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dependency on Release Schedule:</strong> None</p>
<p><strong>Suggested Milestones:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Milestone 1: Ensure all the Python related lint checks are in Pylint. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Moving all checks from <em>BAD_PATTERNS_PYTHON_REGEXP</em> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">general_purpose_linter.py</span></code> to pylint, and</p></li>

<li><p>Remove the PythonLintChecksManager class from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python_linter.py</span> <span class="pre">file.</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Milestone 2: Implement the complete flow for Automating Code Ownership transfer. The design has to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow code owners to define their future unavailability, and collect enough info from them in advance so that the ownership is automatically transferred and restored back on specified dates.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow code owners to define custom availability for each day of the week.</p></li>
<li><p>Each code owner could be assigned to multiple code files, so make sure we properly assign new code owners for each of those files.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The expectation here is to come up with an intelligent approach for doing so, such that it’s least cumbersome and also error-prone and feasible.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Ensure PR authors have proper expectations for when a code review will take place.</p></li>
<li><p>Though the primary task here is to design the flow for temporary ownership transfer, keep the design open to also consider the possibility of permanent transfer (one-time transfer).</p></li>

<h3>Implement schema validators for the handler params<a class="headerlink" href="#implement-schema-validators-for-the-handler-params" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We would like to robustly validate all arguments passed to GET/POST/DELETE handlers and immediately raise a 400 error if an invalid argument is passed. Currently, the handler params are being verified only in some specific cases and there is no unified way to parse more complicated structures like lists and dicts.</p>
<p>This project should add the framework for adding schema validation to all handlers, lint checks ensuring that for newly added handlers schema must be added, and documentation about the schema validation. Then the schema validation should be enabled on at least a part of our current handlers.</p>
<p>The schema validation should be implemented based on schema_utils.py (possibly with additional extensions) or through some third party library.

<p>In the frontend, we have fully-typed TypeScript code in place (although there we still need to finish the implementation of strict typing). In the backend, we should also start using types.</p>
<p>This project should first add Python 3 type checking into the pre-push checks and CI checks (although the current codebase is in Python 2, it will be migrated to Python 3 before GSoC), add documentation about adding types and make sure that types need to be defined for newly added files and code. As for the next part, the assets/constants.ts (constants that are used both in frontend and backend) file should be transformed to protobuf format so that we can leverage typing for our constants too. The last part of this project should implement types for files in core/storage, core/platform, and root folder (feconf.py, utils.py, etc.). In some places we currently use lists of allowed values, these should be transformed to enums.</p>
<p>The checking of type annotations should be done with mypy (or any other typing alternative that implements <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/">PEP484</a>, like pytype or Pyre) checks, preferably we should also implement strict mypy checks, or subset of strict checks that could work even if only a part of the codebase is typed.</p>

<p>The build process that Oppia uses to prepare the files for reliably serving the site was changed quite a lot in the last years: we introduced webpack, changed our build scripts from bash to Python, and also upgraded some libraries. Since a lot of these changes affected the build process and sometimes weren’t accounted for, the build process is now clunky and quite hard to understand.</p>
<p>This project’s aim is to simplify the build process by migrating to Angular-CLI, making it easy for developers to work with it and unifying the multiple entry points that need to build some files (backend tests, e2e tests, frontend tests, local dev server) as much as possible. After the project is complete, all the build-related stuff should be handled exclusively with the Angular CLI.</p>
<p><strong>Note: If the migration of all directives and services is not complete before the start of GSoC, the student may have to migrate the remaining files. Based on the number of files left, we might remove the requirement of the migration to Angular-CLI (if the student is ok with the project be downsized). Hence, there could be a case that you research a lot about Angular-CLI and may not want to/ get to work on it during GSoC. Please consider these before applying to the angular migration project.</strong></p>

<h3>Write Frontend Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#write-frontend-tests" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This project aims to write frontend tests to fully cover each service, directive, and component. When you begin, some files may have tests that incompletely cover the code, while others may have no tests at all. Many of the files you write tests for will contain directives, which you will need to convert to components first. Much of the past work writing frontend tests has been tracked by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/4057">oppia/oppia#4057</a>. You should also look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://mari-zangue.medium.com/my-journey-through-gsoc20-with-oppia-9eb6b27e7a02">blog post</a> by a GSoC student last year who worked on a similar project. This is a good reference, as is our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Frontend-unit-tests-guide">wiki page</a>. It outlines best practices and standard guidelines you should follow.</p>
<p>The project will involve writing a lot of tests. The proposals must contain a concrete plan for how you will cover all of your assigned code in the allotted time. For your reference, here are the line counts as of March 8, 2020:</p>

<p><strong>Consider taking up this project if you:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are interested in testing (since most of the project will involve writing unit tests).</p></li>
<li><p>Have the ability to read through someone else’s code, in order to understand what needs to be tested. (This project will involve reading through a lot of Oppia’s source code.)</p></li>
<li><p>Like to handle technical challenges! It is very likely that you’ll run into problems while trying to test the code as is, and you will almost certainly need to research and come up with solutions to test certain constructs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we’re looking for in the proposal:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Links to one or more PRs in which you added tests for the frontend code. Overall, these PRs should show you adding tests to fully cover at least one service. They should also show you migrating at least one directive to a component and then testing that component.</p></li>
<li><p>A clear demonstration that you can migrate any directive and write tests for any service component. We won’t be assigning specific files until after we have selected students because the files that need to be covered are changing constantly. Therefore, it is critical that you show us you can handle any code we assign you.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dependency on Release Schedule:</strong> None.</p>
<p><strong>Suggested Milestones:</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for 1-3 students to work on this project. Each student will work on covering approximately 3,300 lines of frontend code. You are free to let us know if you have any preferences for what code to work on, but we may not be able to honor your requests.</p>

<h3>Handling Exploration updates in suggestions and ‘lost changes’ improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-exploration-updates-in-suggestions-and-lost-changes-improvements" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>There are several serious issues with current saving/migration workflows in the exploration editor that can occasionally cause loss of work. In particular:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When an exploration is updated, any existing suggestions in the feedback tab should be updated accordingly. Currently, such suggestions are not updated, resulting in a version mismatch and a loss of work when the exploration creator subsequently tries to apply the suggestion.</p></li>
<li><p>When changes cannot be saved to an exploration, a “lost changes” modal pops up so that the creator can make a copy of their edits and then reapply them. However, the code for this modal is not robust, and in particular it does not take into account draft changelists that were stored in an older format. Thus, when it tries to display such drafts, it breaks and ends up not showing anything.</p></li>

<h3>Customize difficulty for practice sessions<a class="headerlink" href="#customize-difficulty-for-practice-sessions" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Currently, in the Practice tab in the topic viewer page, a learner can choose the subtopics to practice and practice questions on them. This project aims to add more customizability where the learner can fine tune the difficulty on which the questions are asked, from each subtopic that they want to practice. Following are main objectives:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Mastery should be calculated at the subtopic level, as the average of mastery of all skills in the subtopic and should be displayed in the topic viewer page.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice sessions should be made more independent and it’s difficulty level also customizable, in the sense that the learner can set the difficulty range of questions that would be asked in the practice session, at a subtopic level.</p></li>
<li><p>These should also be represented by cards. So, in the topic viewer’s Practice tab, there are some cards that we recommend (eg: Easy Questions on Subtopic A, Hard Questions on Subtopic B etc.), which the learner can click to quickly start a session or they can fine tune difficulty per subtopic themselves and start a session as well.</p></li>
<li><p>These cards should be shown based on a learner’s mastery in a subtopic. For example, if a learner has &lt; 50% mastery in a subtopic, we should only show Easy and Easy/Medium practice cards and not Hard etc.</p></li>

<h3>Developer Options Menu<a class="headerlink" href="#developer-options-menu" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The Oppia-Android application needs a developer options menu so that developers can alter app settings or stored data in real time. This is important because during PR reviews and testing there are cases where we need to create data like finishing a topic crashing the app, and doing this manually takes up a lot of time (or even isn’t possible) and therefore having a developer menu where we can do these database related changes easily will make development and testing process easier. Note that a core requirement of this project is to ensure any implemented options do not “punch holes” in the existing app (e.g. if a user is using the production version of the app, it should not contain any code pertaining to the developer menu including the functionality needed to enable the debug functionality).</p>
<p>This option should be visible as a top-level navigation item in the navigation drawer for all profiles, but only if the running app is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Debug</span></code> flavor of the app. It’s expected that this feature will only work on Bazel versions of the app and not Gradle since the former lets us properly exclude functionality from certain builds.</p>
<p>The options/functionality that should be implemented are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The ability to mark each of the following completed with all versions of each as available options (note that this will require validation to make sure the app doesn’t end in a broken state):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Topics</p></li>
<li><p>Stories</p></li>
<li><p>Chapters</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>View analytic event logs</p></li>
<li><p>App-wide behavior changes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Force all hints/solutions on by default (as a toggle)</p></li>
<li><p>Force app to run in wifi/cellular/no network cases irrespective of the actual state on the phone (though we need to take care to make sure impossible cases don’t happen, such as forcing wifi/cellular when there is no connectivity at all)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>An action to crash the app (for investigation &amp; logging purposes)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We have mocks ready for this project, you can view them <a class="reference external" href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/e8aa4198-3940-47f9-514a-f41cc54457f6-9e9b/screen/5ced965e-1a0a-48cf-85dd-f28ba68f0b99/">here.</a></p>

<li><p>Milestone 2: Add support for features that require broader changes: forcing connectivity type, and forcing hints/solutions to automatically show. Note that the functionality used elsewhere in the app to support this should be built in such a way where it’s not included in production builds of the app, and in a way that doesn’t “punch holes” in the app. We suggest considering how staging is done in milestone 1 as a baseline for determining how to approach the work for this milestone.</p></li>

<h3>Static Analysis Checks + Improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#static-analysis-checks-improvements" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>One key part in ensuring a development team reaches optimal efficiency is by ensuring there are reasonable checks in place to avoid regressing previous fixes, reducing trivial verification during code reviews, and ensuring that team members are utilizing best practices. A popular way to achieve this is with static analysis tools like linters. While the Oppia Android team has linters &amp; automated tests implemented, we’d like to fill in some of the gaps in our static analysis tooling by providing ways to enforce best practices &amp; further simplify code reviews.</p>
<p>Suggested checks to add (note that these are picked to provide a wide variety of static analysis support so that the team can add many more checks in the future):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Verify activities have accessibility labels</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that TODOs correspond to current, open issues on GitHub. We should also run this particular analysis check when an issue changes so that we can detect if issues are closed before their TODOs are addressed &amp; then reopen the issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify all production files have a corresponding test file</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure activities/fragments/views can’t be used outside of the app module, or in testing</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure KDocs are present for every non-private class, method, and field (even trivial ones). We expect that this will require an extension to ktlint.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure we can easily add future checks on file names or file contents using RegEx (note that both checks should be able to be matched against filepath patterns, e.g. we may want to verify that all layout XML files don’t use marginLeft)</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all XML files follow our XML style guide</p></li>

<h3>End-to-End Testing Support<a class="headerlink" href="#end-to-end-testing-support" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Oppia Android’s current testing corpus includes unit tests using the Robolectric testing framework &amp; integration tests using the Espresso testing framework (to ensure that the app operates as expected in a real Android environment). The current tests have a few limitations: they do not correctly facilitate cross-activity navigation flows which actual users will be triggering, and they do not verify that the app can interact with Oppia’s backend correctly.</p>
<p>To prepare for the global launch of the app, we need end-to-end tests that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Verify that the app works as a user would expect by playing through select critical user journeys</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that the app operates as expected when interacting with a local developer instance of the Oppia backend server</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We expect that the tests will be written using UiAutomator &amp; are set up for interacting with a local development server (see <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-networking.html">relevant documentation</a>).</p>
<p>Note that this project requires running Linux with virtualization support (in order to run an Android emulator). You will need to make sure your computer supports <a class="reference external" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation">KVM</a> and is running Linux.</p>

<h3>Implement feature flags &amp; platform parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#implement-feature-flags-platform-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>With a large scale system like Oppia, we sometimes have features that contain several points of integration in the codebase, and/or require additional data priming or migrations ahead of the feature being released. These features often span multiple releases and thus require feature flags to gate integration points to ensure that the feature is not partially released ahead of schedule. Moreover, these features often require migrations which need to be run in specific releases due to new versions being made in irreversible data structures (e.g. explorations).</p>
<p>In order to release these types of features in a smooth manner, we want to be able to put these features behind feature flags that are enabled in specific builds (compile-time) and can be enabled dynamically (at runtime). This project aims to introduce compile-time &amp; runtime feature gating for the Android app, leveraging existing runtime gating functionality supported on Oppia web.</p>
<p>Note that this project actually involves introducing what are called platform parameters. These are parameters that can be one of several data types (e.g. strings, integers, booleans). We plan to use the boolean types for gating features as described above, but the other parameters are essential in order to ensure the app is reasonably configurable for many different circumstances (include deprecations). The work difference between specifically supporting booleans &amp; other data types is expected to be small.</p>

<li><p>Milestone 2: Introduce runtime parameter support by hooking up to Oppia backend’s platform parameter API &amp; connecting these flags back to the predefined compile-time parameters. Note that the lifecycle of these parameters need to be carefully managed: they should not be applied until the app restarts. This part of the project will include caching results from the server, and introducing a lightweight synchronization mechanism so that the app periodically verifies that its copies of the parameters are up-to-date. When the device is offline, the flags should have appropriate defaults for the runtime parameters.

<h3>Implement lightweight checkpointing<a class="headerlink" href="#implement-lightweight-checkpointing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Oppia’s lessons can require between 15 minutes and an hour of time depending on a number of factors from learners: understanding of the material, literacy capabilities, and general focus. One potential behavior in the app is that we don’t save the user’s progress if they navigate away from an exploration (lesson) which, given how long lessons can take, is expected to be a frustrating experience. To mitigate this, we’d like to introduce support for a lightweight checkpointing system wherein users’ saved state is fully retained if they navigate away from a lesson &amp; back.</p>
<p>This project is actually part of a larger &amp; broader project happening both in Android &amp; web codebases to introduce the idea of checkpointing: letting learners save their progress at specific points &amp; return to those points. Note that lightweight checkpointing is different than this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Lightweight checkpointing is an Android-only feature</p></li>

<h3>Introduce support for displaying copyright licenses in the app<a class="headerlink" href="#introduce-support-for-displaying-copyright-licenses-in-the-app" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>It’s important for software to properly attribute all dependencies on which it depends, and to display the specific copyright licenses for those dependencies. Beyond being the right thing to do, fulfilling this in a way that can scale across future dependencies can be difficult. In fact, Oppia Android already has nearly 100 transitive (direct + indirect) dependencies, each of which has its own license.</p>
<p>This project aims to introduce the necessary functionality to collect third party licenses, build a UI (via the ‘Help’ menu) to display those licenses (similar to , and add CI checks to ensure future changes don’t break baseline expectations. Note that due to the difficulty of this problem, this project is being scoped down to specific focus on Maven dependencies that we can more easily look up. There will be additional work for the team to complete after this project is done to ensure <em>all</em> dependencies are being considered.</p>
<p>This project will behave similarly to Google’s Play Services <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/android/guides/opensource">version of the feature</a>. Also, please note that this is a Bazel-only feature (which is why we can’t use the Gradle plugin linked earlier).</p>
<p>We recommend that you approach this project as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Utilize a Kotlin script to compile the actual list of dependencies &amp; their versions (+ a link to their license file). This list will actually be explicitly checked into the codebase.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce a GitHub CI check to verify that the list above is kept up-to-date for every code change (which lets us easily audit when indirect dependencies are added).</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce a UI that reads from an asset list file &amp; strings to populate the list of libraries, their versions, and their licenses. These files can be checked into git, but when they are changed (see next step) their changes should never be checked into git. Measures should be taken to prevent this.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce a Kotlin script that, when run, populates the UI files using the dependencies list. This script should fail if the dependencies list is missing any actual new dependencies.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Excellent explanations for when each piece of data will be available, and how. For example, the actual licenses themselves should never be copied into the repository.
