# Welcome to Oppia Web's contributor documentation!

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Oppia project, and making it easier for students to learn online in an effective and enjoyable way!

There are lots of ways to help out and become an Oppia contributor, from joining our team of lesson creators to fixing a bug in the [codebase](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/). Don't worry if you're new to "open source", or if you're still a student -- many of our contributors are, too, and we'd be happy to provide mentorship and support if this is your first time contributing to an open source project. The main thing is that you care deeply about helping people around the world to learn things better, and that you're responsible and reliable.

To make it easier to get started, we've catalogued some of the different ways to help out. Please feel free to take a look through them, and see if any interest you:

* [Coders](Contributing-code-to-Oppia.md)
* [Instructional designers and storytellers](Teaching-with-Oppia.md)
* [UX researchers](Conducting-research-with-students.md)
* [Voice artists](Instructions-for-voice-artists.md)
* [Designers and artists](Contributing-to-Oppia's-design.md)

If you are interested in working on Oppia's Android app, you should also take a look at the [oppia/oppia-android repository](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android).

If you run into any problems, you can check out the [user documentation](http://oppia.github.io/) or post to our [developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-dev). Feel free to drop into our [Gitter chat channel](https://gitter.im/oppia/oppia-chat) to say hello, too :)

Finally, if, after reading the above links, you'd like to help, but aren't sure how -- don't worry! The Oppia project is very multi-faceted, and we'd be glad to help you find something to do that matches your interests and skills. Just fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/jEytndtgdsx7BrnV6) to let us know what you'd like to help with, or write to us at [volunteer@oppia.org](mailto:volunteer@oppia.org) and tell us a bit about yourself and what you'd like to do. We'll do our best to help you get started!
