We're very grateful for BrowserStack's generous support of the open source community. BrowserStack offers free accounts to over a thousand open source projects, empowering organizations like Oppia to test their projects across a vast array of different device and browser configurations.

## What is BrowserStack?

BrowserStack offers a number of tools to help contributors and maintainers complete their tasks more effectively. 

BrowserStack Live allows us to access a vast array of physical devices with various browser and operating system configurations for the sake of manual testing -- you can even test your local machine's development environment on one of BrowserStack's physical devices, right from your browser.

BrowserStack Responsive and BrowserStack Screenshots allow us to quickly test the look of the site for compatibility purposes across a number of different browsers and devices.


## Get Access to BrowserStack

If you'd like to use BrowserStack to test Oppia, please email admin@oppia.org with the subject line _BrowserStack Access_. We'll help you get set up with the requisite login credentials.
