Thanks for your interest in teaching with Oppia! The [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org) site aims to make it easy for you to help other people learn new things. It also provides editing tools and an open commons, so that your work can reach lots of people. We hope that this will raise the bar for education globally, and improve the learning experience for students who don't have access to expert tutors. You can read more about the Oppia project on our [GitHub page](https://oppia.github.io/#/WhatIsOppia), and learn about Oppia's mission from our website: https://www.oppiafoundation.org/.

As a contributor, you are welcome to create a lesson on the Oppia site, but there are also opportunities to be involved as part of a larger effort. Here is a list of our current projects:

## Creating effective basic mathematics lessons

Currently, a large part of the team is focusing on creating a set of lessons to teach basic mathematics, in a way that ensures that everyone in the world can access and learn effectively from these, no matter what their background. (This is important because more than half of children and adolescents worldwide [aren't achieving minimum proficiency in these skills](http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs46-more-than-half-children-not-learning-en-2017.pdf).) Here are some of the existing lessons we've created, with more on the way: [Fractions](https://www.oppia.org/learn/maths/fractions), [Ratios](https://www.oppia.org/learn/maths/ratios) and [Negative Numbers](https://www.oppia.org/learn/maths/negative-numbers).

We welcome help with lesson creation, translations, voiceovers and graphic design! If you'd like to contribute, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/jEytndtgdsx7BrnV6) in order to let us know what you'd like to help with!
