<p>Oppia is participating in <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google Summer of Code 2019</a>! GSoC is a global program which offers post-secondary students an opportunity to discover and work with open source organizations over the course of 3 months, while being paid a stipend. Students work closely with one or more mentors from an open source organization in order to implement either a project idea by the organization, or a proposal of their own.</p>
<p>You might be interested in our GSoC info pages from previous years: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2018">2018</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2017">2017</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2016">2016</a>.</p>
<p>Also, please note that acceptance into GSoC isn’t a prerequisite for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki">becoming an Oppia contributor</a>. The Oppia project is run by the community for the community, and we warmly welcome anyone who’d like to help out!</p>

<h2>Completed Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#completed-projects" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The following projects were fully completed during GSoC 2019:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="xref myst">&#64;anubhavsinha98’s proposal</span> and <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;anubhavsinha98/gsoc19-journey-oppia-308704ffa3a">final blog post</a> for enabling students to say why they provided a given answer. Mentor: Akshay Anand.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 1</strong>: The creator can add an option, for each state, to ask learners for a response. The infrastructure for storing, retrieving and processing responses from the datastore is implemented.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 2</strong>: Learners can submit responses for states (if the creator has asked for this).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 3</strong>: The creator can view all responses received for a state, and can resolve a set of responses by creating a new answer group or updating an existing one.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="xref myst">&#64;Jamesjay4199’s proposal</span> and <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;jamesjay4199/google-summer-of-code-19-at-oppia-foundation-ce18bf34eb8c">final blog post</a> for enabling pages to be served statically. Mentor: Vojtěch Jelínek.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 1</strong>: All static pages serve without Jinja. (NB: dynamic pages are: profile, admin, library, creator_dashboard, skill_editor, story_editor, exploration_{player|editor}, topic_{viewer|editor}, collection_{player|editor}. All others are static.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 2</strong>: All dynamic pages have no Jinja constructs except: interaction_templates, dependencies_html, visualizations_html, value_generators_js, rich_text_components.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 3</strong>: Jinja is fully removed from the Oppia codebase.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="xref myst">&#64;lilithxxx’s proposal</span> and <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;reshav01/google-summer-of-code-19-with-oppia-a4d4318b1808">final blog post</a> for making the codebase compatible with Python 3 and covering the backend fully with tests. Mentor: Brian Rodriguez.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 1</strong>: At most 500 lines of Python code (outside ‘scripts/’) remain untested.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 2</strong>: The Python coverage for the codebase reaches 100% and the codebase supports both Python 2 and 3. There are checks which ensure that both these conditions are preserved going forward.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 3</strong>: All bash files are removed from the codebase.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span class="xref myst">&#64;sophiewu6’s proposal</span> and <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;wushiqi1998/google-summer-of-code-2019-with-oppia-bf585e142a65">final blog post</a> for improvements to the questions framework. Mentor: Vinita Murthi.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 1</strong>: Students encounter review tests after every 2-3 explorations. The modal after each test shows their results for that test.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 2</strong>: The results of the review test are used to pass or fail students, and show follow-up learning advice. Answer groups are linked to misconceptions in the state editor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Milestone 3</strong>: Skill mastery levels are updated after every test, and shown in the frontend (in both the skills tab and the result modals). Questions are selected based on difficulty and skill mastery levels.</p></li>

<p>GSoC is an excellent opportunity for students to get paid to work on an open source project. If you’re interested in applying as a student, you should definitely read the following resources:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/">Google Summer of Code student guide</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/">Google’s list of resources</a></p></li>

<section id="getting-started">
<h2>Getting started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>If you’re interested in applying to work with Oppia for GSoC, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Sign up to the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/oppia-gsoc-announce">oppia-gsoc-announce&#64;</a> mailing list in order to receive important notifications about Oppia’s participation in GSoC. If you like, you can also sign up to the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/oppia-gsoc-discuss">oppia-gsoc-discuss&#64;</a> mailing list to participate in general discussion related to Oppia’s involvement in GSoC (see point 5 below, too). Make sure to set your mailing list preferences correctly so that you actually get the emails!</p></li>
<li><p>Get a better understanding of what Oppia is all about by taking a look at our <a class="reference external" href="http://oppia.github.io/#/">user documentation</a> – this will help you become familiar with important concepts like explorations and interactions. We also recommend having a go at playing some of the existing lessons on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.oppia.org">Oppia.org</a>, like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.oppia.org/fractions">these ones on Fractions</a>, to get a better idea of what they look like.</p></li>
<li><p>Read and follow the instructions in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up">contributors’ guide</a> carefully.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider taking up one or more starter projects in order to become familiar with the contribution process. This will help us get an idea of what it’s like to work with you – e.g. how independent, resourceful, responsive, etc. you are. It will also help you get a better understanding of the codebase, so that you can write a good, detailed project proposal.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Pro-tip!</strong> Quality is more important than quantity; we want to see examples of your best work. So, please make sure to follow the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#instructions-for-making-a-code-change">dev workflow</a> carefully, manually test your code before submitting (to ensure it does what you want it to and doesn’t break anything else), ensure that your code conforms to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Coding-style-guide">style rules</a>, and pay attention to small details. These are good skills to learn when developing software in general, and they will also help you build credibility as a responsible developer who can be trusted to be a good steward of the Oppia codebase.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When you’ve done enough starter projects to get a good understanding for the “lay of the land”, select one or more GSoC projects that you’re most interested in, and write your project proposal! We strongly encourage you to discuss your project ideas and share your proposal with the community, so that you can get feedback and ensure that what you’re writing makes sense to others. The best way to do this is to put your proposal into a collaborative editing tool like Google Docs, allow others to comment on it, and share a link to it on the <a class="reference external" href="mailto:oppia-gsoc-discuss&#37;&#52;&#48;googlegroups&#46;com">GSoC discussion mailing list</a>. You can also email this mailing list if you have any questions about a project, or would like to discuss your approach with the Oppia community and get feedback. Please be specific when asking questions, since this makes it easier for us to help you.</p></li>

<section id="faqs">
<h2>FAQs<a class="headerlink" href="#faqs" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Q: What technical skills do I need to work on Oppia?</strong></p>
<p>A: Familiarity with AngularJS (v1), Python 2.7 and Google App Engine is useful and recommended for most Oppia work. In addition, UI design skills are useful for frontend, user-facing work. Please see the individual project ideas to determine whether these skills are recommended for the project in question.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I increase my chances of getting selected?</strong></p>
<p>A: Writing a good project proposal, engaging with the community, helping other students, successfully contributing patches, and demonstrating that you can work independently can all help you. We’ve also compiled some notes below on the <a class="reference external" href="#selection-criteria">selection criteria</a> we’ll be using this year.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you be flexible around my other commitments in the summer?</strong></p>
<p>A: GSoC is intended to be a full-time commitment, so the main concern is whether you can still get the project done on time. Be upfront about your other commitments and make sure you schedule your time accordingly when creating your proposal. Other commitments you should list include time when you’ll be in school and will commit less time to GSoC, time when you’ll be travelling and away from GSoC work, any summer jobs you need to commit to, etc. We will try to be flexible around other time commitments, as long as your proposal convinces us that you will have enough time to complete the project by the end of the summer. On the other hand, if you do not disclose other commitments, and it turns out that you are unable to commit to what you wrote on your proposal, this is grounds for failing the program.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which projects are most important for Oppia?</strong></p>
<p>A: All the projects we’ve listed here are important, and we’d be very happy to see good progress made on any of them! Projects are treated as equally important during selection. Note that the relative importance of a project to Oppia is not part of the <a class="reference external" href="#selection-criteria">selection criteria</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I submit more than one proposal to Oppia?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes you can. However, we strongly recommend picking one project and writing a solid proposal for the same. Splitting attention across multiple projects might not be a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How early should I start working on the proposal?</strong></p>
<p>A: As early as possible. Make sure to get feedback from mentors before finally submitting the proposal. This will help you to write a better proposal as you can refine the details based on the feedback you receive. The mentors would need some time to review, and hence it is a good idea to begin as early as possible.</p>

<h3>Tips for writing a good project plan<a class="headerlink" href="#tips-for-writing-a-good-project-plan" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The project plan is the most important section of the proposal, since it outlines what you’ll be doing during the summer. We recommend that you follow a structure similar to <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eMivKj5uWkOkj4AB684JVJslAe49gSskZ-VsyUjgPN4/edit">Oppia’s design doc template</a> – if any section isn’t relevant for the project, please keep the section and explain why it’s not relevant.</p>
<p>Here’s some guidance on what the mentors and organization admins will be looking for in this section:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Three clear milestones</strong> explaining the deliverables to be achieved by the end of each of the three GSoC coding periods. Strong proposals will have clear, concrete and measurable milestones, whose success can be objectively evaluated by an external observer. It’s OK to break up a milestone into smaller milestones over smaller timescales, but individual milestones should represent <em>concrete</em> deliverables that can be merged safely into the “develop” branch and included in a subsequent Oppia release. <strong><u>Please try to be realistic when setting milestones, and don’t over-promise.</u></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>A technical design and implementation plan</strong>. The project ideas below are annotated with some notes from the mentors, but please bear in mind that these notes are not exclusive and shouldn’t serve as a substitute for thinking carefully and critically about the project from first principles – their main purpose is to suggest ideas or possible starting points. If, in your thinking, you find aspects not mentioned in the notes, feel free to include a discussion of these aspects in your proposal. (For example, certain projects may require a migration of existing production data, and this needs to be accounted for in the project plan.) Strong proposals will demonstrate familiarity with the codebase, a realistic implementation plan, and attention to detail.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mocks or wireframes</strong>, if appropriate. For user-facing projects, we strongly favour proposals that demonstrate an empathy for the user. If you’re proposing frontend design mocks, we suggest showing your ideas to your friends and getting their critical feedback, so that you can be confident that others find them intuitive as well. Note that your mocks need not be pixel-perfect, but they should illustrate the primary user journeys clearly enough for us to understand exactly what you’re proposing. Also, bear in mind that “more is not necessarily better” – an important aspect of user-focused design is deciding what <em>not</em> to do.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A testing plan.</strong> Testing is an important part of any coding project, and should be taken into account when planning the schedule. In particular, any new functionality added to Oppia’s codebase should be backed by unit tests, and any new core user journey should be accompanied by a corresponding end-to-end test. If your project includes migrations, please also take the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Running-jobs-in-production">pre-release testing in production</a> process into account when planning. Finally,  make sure to budget enough time to test your changes manually before submitting each PR – otherwise, any bugs that are subsequently discovered during review (or the monthly QA process) could result in significant delays and lead to the failure of an otherwise successful project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[NEW!]</strong> Here’s some advice about proposals and milestone timeline planning that we collated from 2018 students and mentors:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Choose a project you’re interested in! If you have a strong interest in your project, this will help you pick up necessary skills and tackle any unforeseen difficulties that arise during GSoC.</p></li>
<li><p>Familiarize yourself with the relevant part of the codebase for your project, especially if you haven’t touched it before. It’s important to think about how to integrate your project with the current Oppia structure – don’t design in a vacuum.</p></li>
<li><p>Define milestones with enough detail to get a proper ETA for each milestone (so, don’t just say “write e2e tests”), otherwise you run the risk of significantly underestimating the timeline.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to design milestones in such a way that the last 1 week of each milestone period is free, and can be used as a testing period.</p></li>
<li><p>The timeline should account for the time it will take to get PRs reviewed. One way to do this is to explicitly specify two dates: (a) when the initial PR should be sent in by, and (b) when it should be merged by.</p></li>
<li><p>If work needs to be done in time for a particular release, the initial PR should be sent well in advance of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Release-Schedule">release cutoff date</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re working on tasks that depend on jobs being <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Running-jobs-in-production">run in production</a>, the timeline should account for any delays inherent in this process.</p></li>

<h2>Types of work related to Oppia projects<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-work-related-to-oppia-projects" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In order to ensure a well-rounded engineering experience, developers will do some or all of the following depending on their project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Meet with their mentors regularly</p></li>
<li><p>Meet with other contributors related to their project area</p></li>
<li><p>Receive code reviews for all code they write for their project</p></li>
<li><p>Write automated tests for their projects</p></li>
<li><p>Create UI mocks (if doing frontend development)</p></li>
<li><p>Write design documents (if implementing large features or introducing new systems)</p></li>

<section id="selection-criteria">
<h2>Selection Criteria<a class="headerlink" href="#selection-criteria" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In order to select students for GSoC, we will mainly be looking at three things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The quality of the submitted proposal</p></li>
<li><p>The quality of the applicant’s previously-submitted PRs (in order to assess their ability to code, debug, break down complex tasks, etc.). Note that quantity isn’t a prerequisite in itself, though contributors who’ve submitted multiple PRs are likely to have had more opportunities to demonstrate the abilities needed to succeed in GSoC.</p></li>
<li><p>Our prior experience working with the student (do they keep commitments, communicate well, demonstrate independence/initiative/responsiveness, help others, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that strong performance in these dimensions is likely to correlate well with the student having an enjoyable, fulfilling and productive experience over the summer, and successfully completing the GSoC program.</p>
<p>For the proposal, we generally look for a clear indication that the student has a good, deep understanding of the project, and has broken it down sufficiently well, in a way that makes it very likely to succeed. Some indicators that could help with this include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A clear analysis of (and good design decisions that build on top of) the original project idea, with a strong focus on creating a simple, intuitive experience for end users.</p></li>
<li><p>A concrete, specific breakdown of the work to be done for each milestone. Here’s an <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vuwXvHOYXqfM2S2B2KIWhZrAa1PL59wJRUYsqJEd67E/edit">example</a> from a previous design doc. (Note that, in the implementation plan, the author has carefully considered and listed which tests need to be written alongside the code; this is a positive indicator.)</p></li>
<li><p>Sufficient concreteness (e.g. references to particular files and methods) to demonstrate that the applicant is familiar with both the scope of the problem and the existing codebase.</p></li>
<li><p>A description, if applicable, of how the applicant plans to mitigate risks that could potentially derail the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear, unambiguous communication. (This is important; your proposal will be read by many mentors!)</p></li>

<p>The following is a list of Oppia’s 2019 GSoC project ideas. (Please note that all mentor assignments listed below are provisional, and may change depending on which proposals are eventually accepted.)</p>
<p>You are welcome to choose among these ideas, or propose your own! However, if you’re planning to propose something original, it’s essential to engage with the Oppia community in order to get feedback and guidance to improve the proposal.

<p>This year, the Oppia team is offering three types of projects: projects that improve the creator experience, projects that improve the learner experience, and infrastructure projects. Some of the project ideas are annotated with notes and suggestions from the mentors, but please bear in mind that the main purpose of these notes is simply to suggest ideas or possible starting points; they aren’t meant to be prescriptive.

<h3>1.1. Building a lesson artist dashboard<a class="headerlink" href="#building-a-lesson-artist-dashboard" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Art and graphics form an integral part of most explorations on Oppia, and are especially important for making lessons learner-friendly and communicating key concepts to learners, especially since good graphics can transcend language barriers. However, one major blocker when creating lessons is the lack of an easy way for designers/artists to add images to lessons. We would like to enable artists to contribute to lessons as easily as developers can contribute to GitHub repositories.</p>
<p>This project has two goals. Firstly, we would like to make it possible to have dedicated artists for explorations: this will allow creators to assign artist roles, and allow the art development workflow to happen in parallel with other creative work. Secondly, we would like to implement a way to organize creation of graphics (using the existing suggestions framework) in a way that mimics the issue tracker on GitHub. More specifically, all open image requests should be surfaced to non-editors/artists of the exploration, who should have the option to suggest an image; once a suggested image is subsequently approved by the editors/artists, it can be added to the lesson.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Suggested milestones</strong></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Implement an “image placeholder” component in rich-text editor fields for explorations, and implement a new role for artists that gives them permissions to contribute images to these image placeholders (or replace existing images). It should also be possible for exploration creators (who, typically, aren’t artists) to upload temporary images to these placeholders, but mark those temporary images as still needing to be replaced with a proper image.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a single common view for all explorations that lists all open image requests. The creator of the exploration should be able to flip a boolean setting which would enable image placeholders within their (typically, not yet published) explorations to be displayed in this common view. The common view should be accessible to all logged-in users and easily reachable from the creator/learner dashboards. Suggestions for images would be submitted through this view.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable users to contribute images for the requests in the common view. Suggested images should appear on the feedback tab of the editor page for the specific exploration. The exploration’s artists/editors should then be able to review the suggestion. If the image is accepted, the suggested image should then be added to the exploration.</p></li>

<h3>1.2. Infrastructure for measuring exploration enjoyability<a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-for-measuring-exploration-enjoyability" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>In order to ensure that students enjoy the lessons on Oppia, we need to develop a way to measure lesson “enjoyability” so that creators can see the effects of their changes. The aim of this project is to define and put in place the necessary infrastructure for this. By the end of the project, we’d like to make it possible for creators to see whether their lessons are enjoyable, as well as figure out which parts of their lessons might be frustrating/confusing/boring so that they can fix those for future learners. We’d also like to introduce a dashboard that makes it easy to see at a glance which lessons need improvement, so that they can be fixed.</p>
<p>In order to do this, we would need to figure out what “enjoyability” means. Here are some initial suggestions for metrics (but you are welcome to suggest your own):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Enjoyability:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did a student finish the exploration?</p></li>
<li><p>Did they carry on to the next exploration in the series?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Possible ways to detect issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Frustration: The student submits more than two answers in a row without leaving the card.</p></li>
<li><p>Confusion: In a particular card, the same answer is submitted more than once, with at least one other answer to that card appearing between consecutive submissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Boredom: <em>We’re not sure :) What do you think?</em></p></li>

<li><p>Find a way to calculate and store the “continuation metric” (i.e. does the student continue with the next lesson in the series). Then, create a dashboard for all curated lessons that shows, for each lesson, the combined completion + continuation stats.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce a frontend service which detects signals indicating student boredom / frustration / confusion, creates cross-sectional metrics in real-time, and sends those metrics to the backend, which stores them as aggregate metrics. Additionally, add new playthrough types to match these metrics as needed (e.g., a playthrough which demonstrates “boredom”), so that these can be used as supporting evidence when debugging the issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Show the signals detected in Milestone 2 in the statistics tab. Audit the full detection/resolution flow and fix any other issues in order to ensure that the end-to-end experience for debugging and improving lessons is fully intuitive.</p></li>

From talking to translators, we have found that there are some improvements that could be made to this platform that would make it easier to translate lessons, namely:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Caching/storing recorded audio locally until it is saved, so that translators can easily check their work by clicking “Play” after uploading an audio file.</p></li>

<h3>1.4. Improvements to the editor saving flow<a class="headerlink" href="#improvements-to-the-editor-saving-flow" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>There are several serious issues with current workflows in the exploration editor that can occasionally cause loss of work. In particular:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When an exploration is migrated to a newer schema version, any existing draft changelists should also be updated accordingly. Currently, draft changelists are not updated, resulting in a version mismatch and a loss of work when the exploration creator subsequently tries to apply the draft. (See #4438 for some discussion.)</p></li>
<li><p>When an exploration is updated, any existing suggestions in the feedback tab should be updated accordingly. Currently, such suggestions are not updated, resulting in a version mismatch and a loss of work when the exploration creator subsequently tries to apply the suggestion.</p></li>
<li><p>When changes cannot be saved to an exploration, a “lost changes” modal pops up so that the creator can make a copy of their edits and then reapply them. However, the code for this modal is not robust, and in particular it does not take into account draft changelists that were stored in an older format. Thus, when it tries to display such drafts, it breaks and ends up not showing anything.</p></li>
<li><p>It is difficult to change an interaction into a slightly different one (e.g. from text input to number-with-input) without losing all the associated responses, hints and solutions. It would be nice to declare a suitable transformation that allows this data to be carried over from one interaction type to a closely-related one, and to auto-migrate as much of the responses as possible so that the creator does not lose their work.</p></li>

If you’d like to get a bit more familiar with the exploration editor, here is a simpler issue along the same lines that you might like to have a go at: When switching from a rule type to a different rule type, the inputs to the old rule type get lost, even though both rule types have the same types of inputs and it is possible to carry the inputs over.</p>

<h3>1.5. Creating a “reviewer view” for explorations<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-reviewer-view-for-explorations" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>In order to ensure a high level of quality, explorations are often reviewed by an experienced lesson creator before publication. However, this is currently a somewhat tedious process that requires lots of clicking from one state to another, which can make it difficult for the reviewer to get a sense of the main “flow” of the exploration.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a more linear, scrollable view of the entire exploration which is optimized for reviewers, and which supports basic commenting functionality. The aim of this project is to build this view.</p>

<li><p>Implement the frontend system for reviewer comments on parts of an exploration.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Proposals must include clear mockups or wireframes for how the display would look. A sample exploration converted into linear view as an example would be great!</p></li>
<li><p>Proposals should clearly indicate how each of the components of an exploration would be handled (interaction, hints, solutions, answer groups). Be sure to think about what makes the most sense for the reviewer – you don’t need to include everything in full detail. For example, the reviewer probably won’t need to see fully-fledged interactions that they can interact with.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposal should explain how branching explorations would be handled. (Note, though, that explorations are typically fairly linear in nature, with branching used only for reviewing earlier material and/or going back to earlier cards. The reviewers’ view should be strongly optimized for that use case, but there should be a clear plan for how to handle non-linear explorations.) Note that the overview graph in the exploration editor page already shows a “main trunk” for the exploration, which could serve as the basis for how to pick the cards to display in a linear view.</p></li>
<li><p>In milestone 2, we recommend trying to expand the existing feedback system to allow references to specific parts of a card, rather than creating a brand-new system from scratch.</p></li>
<li><p>The reviewer view should support simple threaded comments like Google Docs and the existing exploration editor feedback tab (but it doesn’t need to support any form of collaborative editing).</p></li>

<h3>1.6. Allow creation of parameterized questions<a class="headerlink" href="#allow-creation-of-parameterized-questions" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The addition of the upcoming questions framework allows us to create a large question bank for practice questions. However, it would be tedious for creators to create a large number of questions with similar formats but slight variations (e.g. “Add 4/5 and 3/4”, “Add 2/3 and 3/5”, etc.)</p>
<p>Instead, we would like to introduce the concept of parameterized questions, where the creator can specify parameters which can be used to generate many questions at once. (In the example given above, the question might be of the form “Add a/b + c/d”, with parameters a, b, c, d. The question creator would specify ranges of values for the parameters in order to generate questions.)</p>
<p>Note that parameterization might potentially extend to expressing the same question in different ways. For example, we might want to be able to treat the questions “Add a/b + c/d”, “Find the sum of a/b and c/d”, and “{{name}} has a/b of a cake and {{other_name}} has c/d of the same cake; what is the total amount of cake they have?” as the same.</p>

<li><p>Good technical judgement is really important for this project, particularly in ensuring that the system that is built is not too complicated.

<li><p>The existing <a class="reference external" href="http://oppia.github.io/#/Parameters">parameters/expressions framework</a> might be a useful starting point. Note that there is some existing functionality for parameters in the codebase, but it is not well-maintained. It is probably best to figure out a design for this system from scratch, and only then see whether the existing “parameter” functionality can fit well into the proposed system.</p></li>
<li><p>There should be a way for creators to audit that the parameterizations they have picked work well in all cases and result in sensible questions (cf. Milestone 3). The user flow for doing this should be clearly laid out.</p></li>
<li><p>Proposals should explain clearly how the rules in answer groups will handle parameters without complicating the default lesson creation experience. Perhaps there could be an “advanced view” which shows a more complicated UI only when parameters are activated in the Settings tab.</p></li>
<li><p>[Bonus] Currently, Oppia lessons can be augmented with translations and voiceovers in other languages, which are very helpful for learners. It would be great if you could suggest a clean way to handle audio translations for parameterized questions – but note that this isn’t a requirement for the project!</p></li>

<h3>1.7. Community-based voice-over and translation<a class="headerlink" href="#community-based-voice-over-and-translation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Most of the Oppia lessons are in the English language which is used by 15-20% of the entire population in the world. To make our lessons more accessible to people around the world we need our lessons to have translations in different languages. This project focuses on making Oppia lessons more shareable and breaking the language barrier for learning new things by allowing the Oppia community to help to translate and voice-over the exploration in different languages.</p>
<p>The workflow for voiceovers and translations are going to be different as translations can be done incrementally whereas the voiceovers for the entire exploration needs to be done by a single contributor so that we have a consistent voice throughout the exploration. To accommodate such pattern we are thinking of having two workflows:</p>
<p>“Project” workflow for voiceover:
As part of their application, the translator or voice actor should submit a voiceover of the initial state. The proficient voice-artist (in that specific language) would review this and decide:
Whether to accept or reject the application and based on that the contributor will get assigned as a voice-artist for that exploration.</p>
<p>All translators and voice actors should only be actively assigned to one exploration at a time. Once an assignment is made, any remaining pending applications should be cancelled until that task is completed.</p>
<p>“Suggestion” workflow for translations:</p>
<p>A user may decide to suggest a few written translations to exploration, they should be redirected to the translation tab and allowed to add translation suggestion in the specified language. Once they submit a translation, a proficient translator (in that specific language) should either accept or reject the suggestion.</p>

<h3>2.1. Highlight text in a lesson as audio is played<a class="headerlink" href="#highlight-text-in-a-lesson-as-audio-is-played" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We have found that audio voiceovers (especially in native languages) are very helpful for learners for whom English isn’t a first language. However, for longer cards, it is difficult for learners to match the audio voiceover to the text on the card. It would be great for learners to be able to track the audio with the text.</p>

<h3>2.2. Review tests and other improvements to the questions framework<a class="headerlink" href="#review-tests-and-other-improvements-to-the-questions-framework" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>While explorations and stories help encourage a learner to continue learning, it is also useful for a learner to be able to keep track of their understanding as their learning progresses. Review tests are an upcoming feature in Oppia that aims to help learners test the skills they’ve learned after they have completed 2-3 lessons in a story in that topic. These review tests would be automatically presented to the learner once they have progressed up to a certain point in the story, and would need to be completed successfully in order to advance to the next part of the story.</p>
<p>This project aims to create the learner view for review tests, and to improve the question framework as a whole so that the experience of practising questions on Oppia (via pre-tests, review tests and practice sessions) is as effective and enjoyable as possible.</p>

<li><p>Update the question player framework to return more information than just the score, once the learner has completed the test. Specifically, the question player framework should be able to return the score, as well as calculate and return the mastery of the skill(s) that were tested.

<li><p>Use the skill mastery information returned by the question player API in each of the tests (i.e. pre-tests, practice sessions, and review tests). Each of the tests would have to use the skill mastery levels in different ways. Pre-tests would use mastery to decide whether the learner has passed the requirements and can proceed with the lesson, whereas review tests and practice sessions would use the mastery values primarily to keep track of the learner’s progress and pass on recommendations for next steps to the learner.</p></li>

There should be an effective way for learners to do this as needed, in a topic or in an exploration.

<p>This project aims to improve backend test coverage to 100%, and then migrate the backend codebase to be simultaneously compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3. The reason these two projects are linked is because one prerequisite for a safe migration is to have full test coverage, so it’s important to make sure that the backend coverage is 100% before migrating. We would also like to standardize all scripts in the codebase to be written in Python (currently, there is a mixture of bash and Python being used).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot do a full migration to Python 3 at this time due to incompatibility issues with Google App Engine (GAE) dependencies. So, the current plan is to have the codebase python3 ready, so that we can easily upgrade to python3 as soon as the GAE issues are resolved.</p>

<p><strong>Potential mentors</strong>: <strong>&#64;vojtechjelinek</strong> (primary), <strong>&#64;bansalnitish</strong></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge/Skills needed</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bash</p></li>
<li><p>Python (to understand the use cases of the library)</p></li>
<li><p>Javascript (to understand the use cases of the library)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggested milestones</strong></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Upgrade 70% of the libraries in ./third_party, with no regressions.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade 100% of the libraries in ./third_party, with no regressions.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade Node to the latest stable version and then upgrade all libraries in ../node_modules. Upgrade all libraries in ../oppia_tools.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Easy/Medium</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An important part of upgrading libraries is to make necessary changes to support the upgraded libraries (in case new versions introduce breaking changes or are not backward-compatible). There are several libraries in ./third_party for which this is more difficult than others. The proposal should explain which libraries these are, and describe a plan to upgrade them safely.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that Milestone 3 comes last because node and ../oppia_tools are not user-facing.</p></li>
<li><p>Proposals should explain how they intend to measure progress, and how the “70%” number in Milestone 1 can be verified objectively.</p></li>

<h3>3.5. Static serving<a class="headerlink" href="#static-serving" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Currently, Oppia serves all pages using the Jinja templating engine, which isn’t very efficient – for one thing, because pages are dynamically composed using Jinja, they can’t be cached. The aim of this project is therefore to serve as much of Oppia’s pages as we can statically, and handle all dynamic content using AJAX calls. In order to do this, we’ll need to get rid of the Jinja footprint in our codebase. Furthermore, we sometimes use Jinja to include static files (like header_js_libs.html or footer.html); and will therefore need to find an alternative way to include these in a Jinja-less environment (perhaps in our build process, or with ngInclude).</p>

Identify other issues that can arise from serving the remaining pages statically.</p></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The proposal should include a clear analysis of how to get rid of Jinja for all pages.</p></li>
<li><p>This project may require some changes in the build process, because we currently sometimes use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{%</span> <span class="pre">include</span> <span class="pre">%}</span></code> just to have clearer dev processes. Good proposals will include a coherent analysis of how to deal with this issue, as well as the pros/cons of possible approaches. Some starting-point ideas are provided below, but there may be others:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>re-build the finalized templates at release time, then serve them statically from then on (rather than try
to re-construct them at every request). But how would we handle local development, where the changed files must be available immediately?</p></li>
<li><p>Look into stuff like ngInclude in Angular. But that might lead to too many calls to the server (even if only to retrieve static files). That said, we could cache the templates.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>This project requires the usage of some kind of module bundling (webpack). We hope to have this completed prior to GSoC – please talk to <strong>&#64;vojtechjelinek</strong> for more details.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to get rid of Jinja, we need to find alternative ways to handle all the GLOBALS variables that are currently sent to the frontend using Jinja. Work on this is currently ongoing at #5002 – please talk to <strong>&#64;vojtechjelinek</strong> if you’d like to help with this.</p></li>

<h3>3.6. Validate invariants between data models<a class="headerlink" href="#validate-invariants-between-data-models" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We would like to validate that Oppia deployments have valid data and relationships between datastore storage models. Some sample validations include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All explorations have correct ExplorationRights objects defined</p></li>
<li><p>All images are linked up with an existing exploration</p></li>
<li><p>All audio files are linked up with an existing exploration</p></li>
<li><p>All explorations in collections have corresponding model instances</p></li>
<li><p>Feedback/Suggestions have corresponding explorations attached to them</p></li>
<li><p>All RTE fields are correctly formatted</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of this project is to figure out all the invariants that should hold between Oppia storage models, and put in place an audit job to verify that they hold in a production deployment, as well as put steps in place to ensure that, if the invariants hold at a point in time, they continue to hold in perpetuity.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Medium</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge/Skills needed</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Python</p></li>
<li><p>Map Reduce jobs</p></li>
<li><p>Good technical design</p></li>
<li><p>Good eye for testing</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggested milestones</strong></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Update the backend code to ensure that all desired invariants continue to hold in perpetuity, and create an audit job to verify that all desired invariants hold. This audit job should be run in production immediately after Milestone 1 and will produce a list of discrepancies that need to be addressed.</p></li>
<li><p>Resolve at least half of the discrepancies found during Milestone 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Resolve all the discrepancies found during Milestone 1.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The above list is not representative, and we expect there to be many more such validations. The proposal should include a full list of these.</p></li>
